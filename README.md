## Hi there, I'm Anne Friedman

Currently, I am a senior at Scripps College majoring in Data Science and minoring in English and Spanish. I am interested in the applications of data analysis to different fields and interests, including journalism, sports, and human rights. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my senior thesis and senior capstone
- ⚾️ I'm excited to attend the 2025 Society of American Baseball Research Analytics Conference
- 💬 Ask me about different projects I worked on:
    - Analyzed how congressional district maps in litigation in nine U.S. states could have affected the outcome of the 2024 U.S. House of Representatives election. See [project repository](https://github.com/elemiller31/Math195-Final-Project).
    - Researched illiteracy in Uruguayan prisons to evaluate impact of existing prison literacy programs.
    - Identified racial and other trends in police stop data from 2022 from the Palo Alto Police in compliance of California's Racial and Identity Profiling Act.
- 📫 How to reach me: akfriedman13@gmail.com
